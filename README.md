This simple problem is designed to assess your skills in designing and implementing an API using Django and related technologies.

## Photos App

---

Write a Django app called photos, and provide API to accomplish following features. Estimated time is 3 - 5 hours for the main features, depending on the your experience level. It's acceptable to take more time.

- ASC/DESC Sort photos on publishing date
- Filter photos by user.
- Limit the uploaded photo size to a certain maximum dimensions and bytes.
- JWT authentication.
- Host it somewhere like Heroku or PythonAnywhere.com, both offer free hosting for python apps.
- Maintain a good git history.

## Bonus Features

If time permits, add following features.

- Remove the dimension/size limit, and store the original photo, but serve only proportionally
- resized/cropped photos based on pre-defined dimensions.
- Implement batch upload, edit, delete, publish API for photos.
- Support #tags in captions, and filtering on the same.

## What we are looking out for

---

- Understanding project requirements.
- Able to identify and design a data model with attributes and their constraints.
- Ability to write clean code.
- Ability to utilize the various tools provided by Django or the framework in use*.
- Ability to implement APIs according to RESTFul conventions.
- Ability to write tests for APIs.
- Code coverage.
- Able to identify the need for and use of third-party packages.

## *Note:

---

Django is being used in production therefore it is the recommended framework to complete this assignment in.

If you have to, use popular framework/languages such as Express/JS, RubyOnRails/Ruby, Laravel/PHP, Golang, flask as these are the frameworks/languages that the team is able to read and evaluate.
